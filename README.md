## 🎓 Abstract
Traditional career guidance systems suffer from two extremes: they are either too rigid (rule-based) or too unpredictable (black-box AI). This project introduces a **Hybrid Intelligence Architecture** that orchestrates three distinct AI modalities to generate highly personalized, accurate, and adaptive learning roadmaps.

## 🧠 System Intelligence
The system operates on an "Intelligence Loop" comprising:
1.  **Symbolic AI (Rule Engine)**: Enforces hard constraints (e.g., "Must know Python before TensorFlow").
2.  **Probabilistic AI (Random Forest)**: Predicts career suitability based on statistical patterns in user data.
3.  **Generative AI (GPT-4)**: Synthesizes structured, pedagogical content tailored to the user's specific skill gaps.
4.  **Adaptive Feedback**: Learns from user progress to refine future recommendations.

## 🏗️ Architecture
Refer to `architecture_docs.md` for detailed diagrams.
- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS (Responsive UI).
- **Backend API**: Node.js, Express (Orchestrator).
- **ML Microservice**: Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn (Prediction).
- **Database**: MongoDB (Persistence & Analytics).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Smart Roadmap Generation**: Not just a list, but a phased strategic plan.
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Visualizes exactly what you are missing for a target role (Core vs Recommended).
- **Progress Tracking**: Interactive checklists that update your learner profile.
- **Self-Evaluation**: Built-in analytics to measure learning velocity and completion rates.
- **Data Export**: Generates labeled datasets from user history for future model retraining.
