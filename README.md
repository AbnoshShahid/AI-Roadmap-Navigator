# AI Roadmap Navigator

## Overview
Traditional career guidance systems usually follow fixed rules or rely completely on AI predictions, which can be inaccurate or confusing.  
AI Roadmap Navigator solves this problem by combining rules, machine learning, and AI-generated content to create clear, personalized learning roadmaps for users.

This system helps users understand:
- What skills they already have
- What skills they are missing
- What to learn next and in what order

---

## How the System Works
The system uses a Hybrid Intelligence approach, meaning it combines multiple AI techniques instead of relying on just one.

### Rule-Based Intelligence (Symbolic AI)
- Applies fixed learning rules
- Example: You must learn Python before learning Machine Learning
- Ensures logical and correct learning paths

### Machine Learning (Probabilistic AI)
- Uses a Random Forest model
- Predicts which career path best suits the user
- Analyzes skills, interests, and learning patterns

### Generative AI
- Uses AI to generate step-by-step learning roadmaps
- Roadmaps are customized based on:
  - User skills
  - Career goals
  - Skill gaps

### Adaptive Feedback
- Tracks user progress
- Improves future recommendations automatically

## System Architecture
The project is built using a modern full-stack architecture.

### Frontend
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Fully responsive and user-friendly interface

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Acts as the main controller between frontend and AI services

### Machine Learning Service
- Python
- FastAPI
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Handles career prediction logic

### Database
- MongoDB
- Stores users, skills, roadmaps, and progress

Detailed architecture diagrams are available in the file:
